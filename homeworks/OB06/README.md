# Kanban management of duel game
"Duel" is simple test game modelling exchange of shots between 2 heroes.

The partipants have limited set of shots and exchange the shots while moving towards each other. Accuracy of shots depends on health state and distance. 

Therefore there is a strategic moment - whether shot as early as possible to disable the rival or wait until surely shot him at blankpoint; so game isn't completely trivial.

Currently , the game models only this shots exchange, 
Later, I plan to add strategies for "AI" or control one of  participants interactively
